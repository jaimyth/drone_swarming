# drone_swarming
This is a simulation tool of a drone show using particle swarming principles.
To try the tool, run main.py
main.py has two inputs, amount of particles n and add_leader, determining if a leader particle is present or not.

When main.py is run, a Pygame window will open. The keyboard inputs to toggle certain behaviour is indicated with the
keys in between the square brackets, i.e. [C].
